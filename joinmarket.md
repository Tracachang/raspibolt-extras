## JoinMarket guide for RaspiBolt

### Introduction

[JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver) is a CoinJoin software, which allows you to increase privacy and fungibility of on-chain Bitcoin transactions. It includes it's own Bitcoin wallet, backed by `bitcoind`, and users market / taker model, which means that either you pay small fee for CoinJoin privacy or just keep software running and then you get paid for providing liquidity for CoinJoin's. Even if you aren't interested in privacy of your coins, you can use JoinMarket for some little passive income from your bitcoins, without giving up your private keys.

### Preparations

#### Install dependencies

* With user "admin", install necessary dependencies

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv curl python3-dev python3-pip build-essential automake pkg-config libtool libgmp-dev
```

#### Tor (optional)

It isn't strict requirement, but for the privacy it's recommended to use JoinMarket with Tor. Follow [RaspiBolt Tor guide](https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/raspibolt_69_tor.html) on how to install Tor on your RaspiBolt.

### Install JoinMarket

* Open a “bitcoin” user session and change into the home directory

`$ sudo su - bitcoin`

* Download, verify and extract the latest release (check the [Releases page](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/releases) on Github for the correct links)

```
# download software
$ mkdir /home/bitcoin/download
$ cd /home/bitcoin/download
$ wget -O joinmarket-clientserver-0.5.5.tar.gz https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/archive/v0.5.5.tar.gz
$ wget https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/releases/download/v0.5.5/joinmarket-clientserver-0.5.5.tar.gz.asc

# verify that the release is signed by Adam Gibson (check the fingerprint)

```

* Install JoinMarket (press "n" and Enter when asking about Qt dependencies)
```
$ tar xvzf joinmarket-clientserver-0.5.5.tar.gz -C /home/bitcoin
$ cd /home/bitcoin/joinmarket-clientserver-0.5.5/
$ ./install.sh 

        INFO: Joinmarket-Qt for GUI Taker and Tumbler modes is available.
        Install Qt dependencies (~160mb) ? [y|n] : n
...
```

### First run

```
$ source jmvenv/bin/activate
(jmvenv) $ cd scripts
(jmvenv) $ python wallet-tool.py
Created a new `joinmarket.cfg`. Please review and adopt the settings and restart joinmarket.
```

* Edit configuration file (`nano -w joinmarket.cfg`) and specify your bitcoind RPC settings. Optionally, if you have Tor enabled, comment out clearnet host entires under `[MESSAGING:server1]` and `[MESSAGING:server2]` and uncomment the ones with `.onion` addresses and `socks5 = true`.
```

### Generate JoinMarket wallet
```
(jvmenv) $ python wallet-tool.py generate
Would you like to use a two-factor mnemonic recovery phrase? write 'n' if you don't know what this is (y/n): n
Not using mnemonic extension
Enter wallet file encryption passphrase: 
Reenter wallet file encryption passphrase: 
Input wallet file name (default: wallet.jmdat): 
Write down this wallet recovery mnemonic

hour embark smile mansion wisdom rebel loud enhance clean man panel broccoli

Generated wallet OK
```
Write down the words, they would allow to recover wallet later on different machine in case of hardware failure or other problem.

### Fund JoinMarket wallet

JoinMarket wallet contains of five separate sub-wallets or pockets called "mixdepths". Idea is that coins between different mixdepths are never mixed together. When you do a CoinJoin transaction, change output goes back to the same mixdepth, but one of the equal amount outputs goes either to address of a different wallet (if you are taker) or to a different mixdepth in the same JoinMarket wallet (if you are a maker).

* Run `wallet-tool.py` default method to get list of addresses. Send some bitcoins to the first address of mixdepth 0. At first run it will give a message about need to restart JM and rescan blockchain. No need to rescan, just run command again.
```

### Running a yield generator bot

Yield generator is a maker bot provides liquidity to the JoinMarket, so that others (takers) can make a CoinJoin's and they pay you a small fee for the service. It is recommended to fund your JoinMarket wallet with at least 0.1 BTC to run yield generator. But general principle is - the more funds you deposit in the wallet, the bigger chance of having passive CoinJoin transactions you have. But don't go reckless and remember that it is a hot wallet, so security is not the same as with a hardware wallet or other cold storage.

* Read the basics: https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/YIELDGENERATOR.md

* Look at the settings (`nano -w yg-privacyenhanced.py`) and change them if you want to. Defaults could be ok, but you could also lower minium CoinJoin transaction amount (`minsize`) to 10000 sats (0.001 BTC, default is 100000 sats or 0.01 BTC). Also current relative CoinJoin maker fee (`cjfee_r`) default is 0.02%, you might want to rise it to 0.03%, as it is what Wasabi Wallet charges per anonimity set (`cjfee_r = 0.0003`). Note that values are approximations, yg-privacyenhanced will randomize them a little bit, due to privacy reasons.

* Run yield generator
```
(jmvenv) $ python yg-privacyenhanced.py wallet.jmdat
```

* Look at [tmux](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1) or [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), to keep yield generator running after you close ssh connection to the RaspiBolt.

### Sending payments

Note that you cannot use JoinMarket as a taker while yield generator is running with the same wallet. Before sending payments, you should stop yield generator, pressing Ctrl+C in a screen where it is running. So, idea is to stop yield generator, do your payment as a taker, and then start yield generator again. Mixing maker and taker roles in a single wallet is actually good for your privacy too.

* See https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md#try-out-a-coinjoin-using-sendpaymentpy

### Checking wallet balance and history

* Summary of wallet balances: `python wallet-tool.py wallet.jmdat summary`

* Wallet transaction history: `python wallet-tool.py wallet.jmdat history -v 4`

### Other notes

* Every time you disconnect from the RaspiBolt and connect again, if you are in a fresh session, before running any JoinMarket commands you need to do the following from "bitcoin" user:
```
$ cd /home/bitcoin/joinmarket-clientserver-0.5.0
$ source jmvenv/bin/activate
(jmvenv) $ cd scripts
```
